# glasses filter using python 

you need tensorflow, opencv, numpy, and pandas for this project 

I made two versions image and video  

but for the image version because im using a desktop and I don't have a camera the only thing you need to do is change running = False to True in order for the camera to work and don't forget to read the image from the last_frame 

other then that the modle is already trained but if you want to train your own model you can find the data set in here

And thats it start shades.py and have fun
